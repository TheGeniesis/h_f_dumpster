# Dumpster

Helper scripts to do actions which are done rarely but repetitively.

Not maintained in daily basis, more when there is a need to use them.

## Doc

Files with quick notes, nothing well edited. Maybe split it to files somewhere in the future (aka never)

## Parameters

[direnv](https://direnv.net/) recommended to load variables when needed.

`.envrc.dist` has env variables needed to be used. Create a copy of the file `.envrc` and put there correct values
